## Fully connected neural network on MNIST dataset

a) Open the notebook [fcn_MNIST.ipynb](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/dl_course_2018/blob/master/notebooks/05_fcn_MNIST.ipynb).
In this notebook we use a fully connected neural network to predict the handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset.  
We have 4000 examples with 784 pixel values and 10 classes. Run the fist 3 cells.

b) Write the missing TensorFlow code in cell 4 for the first hidden layer.

c) Run the next two cells to store the graph and do a forward pass of the untrained network. Have a look at the network.

d) Now lets train the model. Finish the code to calculate the loss and accuracy for the validation set.
